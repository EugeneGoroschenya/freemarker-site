Apache FreeMarker Site
----------------------

This is the project with which we generate the freemarker.apache.org home page.
Note that most of the work is done by Apache FreeMarker Docgen, which is
a dependency of this project.

To publish the built site, commit the output into the "asf-site" branch.

Note that as of this writing, the "docgen" dependency is get from the Ivy
repo on the published homepage (http://freemarker.apache.org/repos/ivy/). Those
modifying docgen should upload the fresh docgen jar there. Then you need to
run `ant update-deps` here to grab the latest version.
