Apache FreeMarker Site
----------------------

This is the project that generates the freemarker.apache.org home page,
except the documentation of FreeMarker, or of other released products.
Note that most of the work is done by the freemarker-docgen depedency. (If
Maven can't get the proper version of that depedency, try the Apache Maven
repository, or you have to check out freemarker-docgen "mvn install" it
locally.)

To build the site, issue:

  mvn package

This will output the site into target/site. To publish the built site, commit the
output into the "asf-site" branch of the freemarker-site Git repo.

This project shouldn't be deployed or installed, as it produces no
meaningful artifact.
